# ツ A case study (Region of Interest):
Planning for the post-February 6 earthquake.

# ツ Aim and objectives:

We tried to show on the map the infrastructure and lines we chose (including the resources we obtained) in order to minimize the earthquake and damage that affected our country on February 6th. 

While examining the damaged areas on the map for our assignment, we chose the province of Adıyaman, taking into account the sources of the studies we will do. For this reason, we calculated the proximity to the imaginary assembly area on the map and designed the power plant and treatment facilities.

# ツ Requirements:

Since our group consists of three people; We showed; 

• Power (electricity) line

• Water infrastructure

• Transportation line

As a result of our research, we felt the need to explain a little bit in our report about the processes they went through to provide electricity and water. All three team members of our group produced a cartographic map that supports these three requirements.

# ツ Data:

OpenStreetMap

# ツ Maps:
